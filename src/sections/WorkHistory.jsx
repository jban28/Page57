            My HR career includes nearly twenty years working in a variety of HR roles with not for
            profit organisations. After working in social services and education departments at Kent
            County Council and Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council, and a period with an HIV charity in
            West London, I joined the NHS in early 2001. The NHS is a complex and dynamic system and
            I worked in a number of different roles across community health, acute and mental health
            before deciding to work freelance in March 2016.

            Working freelance requires the ability to quickly build trust and to confidently explore with a
            client the presenting issues, and to uncover the underlying problems too. I enjoy this
            exploration with clients and analysing what's going on, and then moving to developing
            solutions.
