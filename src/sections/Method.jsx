                    My belief is that to be effective HR interventions must be designed for the particular
                    context, taking account of culture and business/service needs.

                <p className="mb-3">
                    Whilst valuing my professional experience and qualifications highly, my preference is to
                    work in a friendly and relatively informal way. I like to work in partnership with clients to
                    first clarify the issues or problems at hand.

                <p className="mb-3">
                    Depending on the issues we might then generate options for consideration. These can be
                    tested for your environment, taking account of your preferred working style, company
                    culture and relevant workforce data.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3">
                    I'm happy to generate a range of options for you to consider, with detailed analysis of the
                    data together with recommendations. I am also comfortable with a less formal approach
                    and the degree of detail provided will depend on the issues you are keen to address.

                    Alternatively, you may have a project that needs implementing. I am comfortable to work
                    flexibly with you to identify your needs and to provide as much or as little support as you
                    need to deliver the project.
